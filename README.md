OpenSCAD and STL models of an Acorn Risc PC power button.

The OpenSCAD model is parameterised in numerous ways, e.g. to add a reinforced stem.

**Note**: I've not 3D printed and fettled / fine tuned this model as yet. It was measured from the real thing to an accuracy of 0.1mm but that's no guarantee that it'll work in its current state.
